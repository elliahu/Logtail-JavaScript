# Logtail JavaScript

Collect logs from both the Node.js backend and your frontend.

# Example project

To help you get started with logging using Logtail, we have created an example project. 

Make sure you have `npm` installed and also make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and up-to-date.

## Install the example project

Clone the git repository or download it as a ZIP and extract it into a select directory which will be your projects directory.

Then run the following command to install all dependencies (`@logtail/js`):

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the example project

To run the example project, simply run the following command and don't forget to replace the `<source-token>` with your actual source toke, which you can find in source settings.

```bash
node index.js <source-token>
```

You should see the following output:

```
Output:
All done! You can check your logs now.
```

This will generate a total of 4 logs, which can be displayed in your Logtail live monitor.
